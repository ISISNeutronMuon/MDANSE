    This configurator allows to choose the level of granularity in the atom selection.
    
    When reading the trajectory, the level of granularity will be applied by grouping the atoms of the selection
    to a single dummy-atoms located on the center of gravity of those atoms.
    
    The level of granularity currently supported are:
    
    * 'atom': no grouping will be performed
    * 'group': the atoms that belongs to a MMTK AtomCluster object will be grouped as a single atom per object while the ones that belongs to a MMTK Molecule, NucleotideChain, PeptideChain and Protein object will be grouped according to the chemical group they belong to (e.g. peptide group, methyl group ...)
    * 'residue': the atoms that belongs to a MMTK AtomCluster or Molecule object will be grouped as a single atom per object while the ones thta belongs to a MMTK NucleotideChain, PeptideChain or Protein object will be grouped according to the residue to which they belong to (e.g. Histidine, Cytosyl ...)
    * 'chain': the atoms that belongs to a MMTK AtomCluster or Molecule object will be grouped as a single atom per object while the ones that belongs to a MMTK NucleotideChain, PeptideChain or Protein object will be grouped according to the chain they belong to
    * 'molecule': the atoms that belongs to any MMTK chemical object will be grouped as a single atom per object
