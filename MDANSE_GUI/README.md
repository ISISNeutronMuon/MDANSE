# MDANSE_GUI 

## MDANSE_GUI Python Module

This is the module containing the Graphical User Interface (GUI) of the
Molecular Dynamics Analysis for Neutron Scattering Experiments (MDANSE) software package.

The GUI depends on the [MDANSE package](https://www.isis.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/MDANSEproject.aspx).

## Version information

This is the alpha release of MDANSE_GUI 0.1.0. The GUI has been re-written completely using Qt.
Please help us develop MDANSE_GUI by reporting any problems you experience when using the code.
The preferred way of reporting problems is by adding them to the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/ISISNeutronMuon/MDANSE/issues).

## Quick start: installation

We recommend that you install MDANSE in a Python virtual environment. You can create a virtual environment named mdanse_env by typing
```
python3 -m venv mdanse_env
```

To activate your virtual environment, type
```
source mdanse_env/bin/activate
```
in a bash console, or
```
mdanse_end/Scripts/activate.bat
```
if you are using cmd.exe on Windows.

While your virtual environment is active, you can install MDANSE:
```
pip install MDANSE_GUI
```
and start the GUI by typing
```
mdanse_gui
```

## Quick start: workflow

The typical workflow of MDANSE:

1. Convert a trajectory from the file format generated by an MD simulation software into the MDANSE trajectory format,
2. Load the converted trajectory into MDANSE,
3. Perform an analysis,
4. Check the results with the plotter.

Each one of these operations (apart from the plotter) has its own dedicated tab in the GUI. The plotter can be started
using a button on the top toolbar.

The most complete user documentation of MDANSE can be found on [our Read the Docs page](https://mdanse.readthedocs.io/en/protos).

Other information including example scripts can be found on the [MDANSE website](https://www.isis.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/MDANSEproject.aspx)
