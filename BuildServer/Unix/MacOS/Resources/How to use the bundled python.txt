How to use the bundled python
=============================

TL;DR: always use /Applications/MDANSE.app/Contents/MacOS/python2

MDANSE comes with a bundled python that you can use to run scripts that use MDANSE. It has all the functionality
of a normal python installation, including several preinstalled libraries, most important of which are:
 - numpy
 - MMTK
 - Scientific
 - matplotlib
 - vtk

The python version is 2.7.18 and can be accessed through an executable script located at
/Applications/MDANSE.app/Contents/MacOS/python2 (/Applications is the installation directory)
There are two python files in the MacOS directory, but ONLY USE THE ONE CALLED python2!

The other python file, python, is the actual python executable, but it's missing some key
paths and so does not work as-is. The script you should use, python2, sets these automatically
and behaves almost exactly like a normal python executable. That said, if you have any issues
with the script, please let us know. In the meantime, you can use the following commands
in a bash (terminal) to use the bundled python:
 $ PARENT_DIR=/Applications/MDANSE.app/Contents
 $ export PYTHONHOME=$PARENT_DIR:$PARENT_DIR/Resources
 $ export PYTHONPATH=$PARENT_DIR/Resources/lib/python2.7:$PARENT_DIR/Resources:$PARENT_DIR/Resources/lib/python2.7/site-packages

Once these environment variables are set, you can use the proper python, though only in the
current bash session:
 $ /Applications/MDANSE.app/Contents/MacOS/python
