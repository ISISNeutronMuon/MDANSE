MDANSE (Molecular Dynamics Analysis for Neutron Scattering Experiments) is a python application 
for analyzing molecular dynamics simulation data

MDANSE currently works on unix debian-like (e.g. ubuntu) and Windows. There is little system-specific 
code in MDANSE itself, so porting MDANSE to other systems should be straightforward .
However, we cannot provide any support for this.

If you have any questions about MDANSE, please contact the authors.
