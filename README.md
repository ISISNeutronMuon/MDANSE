MDANSE (Molecular Dynamics Analysis for Neutron Scattering Experiments) is a 
python application   
for analyzing molecular dynamics simulation data.

MDANSE currently works on unix debian-like (e.g. ubuntu) and Windows. 
There is little system-specific  
code in MDANSE itself, so porting MDANSE to other systems should be 
straightforward. However, we cannot  
provide any support for this.

MDANSE is developed and maintained by:
