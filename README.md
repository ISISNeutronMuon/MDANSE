**MDANSE (Molecular Dynamics Analysis for Neutron Scattering Experiments)**

MDANSE is a python application designed for computing neutron observables from molecular dynamics trajectories that can be directly compared with neutron scattering experiments, particularly inelastic and quasi-elastic neutron scattering spectroscopies.

MDANSE has intercaes with molecular dynamics softwares such as CASTEP, DLPOLY, GROMACS, LAMPS

MDANSE can be run on Linux, Windows and McOS.
