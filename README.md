MDANSE (Molecular Dynamics Analysis for Neutron Scattering Experiments) is a python application 
for analyzing molecular dynamics simulation data

MDANSE should work with all major variants of Unix (including Linux
and MacOSX) and Windows. There is little system-specific code in MDANSE 
itself, so porting MDANSE to other systems should be straightforward.
However, we cannot provide any support for this.

If you have any questions about MDANSE, please contact the authors.
