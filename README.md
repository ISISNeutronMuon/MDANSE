# MDANSE 

## Molecular Dynamics Analysis for Neutron Scattering Experiments

MDANSE is a Python application designed for computing neutron observables from molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories. The results can 
be directly compared with neutron scattering experiments, particularly inelastic and quasi-elastic neutron scattering 
spectroscopies.

To do this, MDANSE reads trajectories created with MD simulation software
such as CASTEP, VASP, DMOL, Gromacs, DL_POLY, CHARMM, LAMMPS, PBD, DFTB etc.,
and provides both a graphical user interface (GUI) and a command line interface. 

This project is built on the development published previously: \
G. Goret, B. Aoun, E. Pellegrini, "MDANSE: An Interactive Analysis Environment for Molecular Dynamics Simulations", 
J Chem Inf Model. 57(1):1-5 (2017).

## Version information

This is the 2.x branch of MDANSE, which consists of two Python packages, MDANSE (the analysis code) and MDANSE_GUI (the user interface). The final version in the 1.5.x series can still be found in the **legacy** branch, but is not being actively developed.

The current version of MDANSE is currently still at the _beta_ stage. You can help it advance to the official release stage by reporting problems you experience while using MDANSE.

## Quick start: installation

We recommend that you install MDANSE in a Python virtual environment. You can create a virtual environment named mdanse_env by typing
```
python3 -m venv mdanse_env
```

To activate your virtual environment, type
```
source mdanse_env/bin/activate
```
in a bash console, or
```
mdanse_end\Scripts\activate.bat
```
if you are using cmd.exe on Windows.

While your virtual environment is active, you can install MDANSE:
```
pip install MDANSE MDANSE_GUI
```
and start the graphical interface by typing
```
mdanse_gui
```

## Installation: development version

At the moment MDANSE and MDANSE_GUI are undergoing frequent changes. If you would
like to try out the latest development version, you can install directly from GitHub
using pip:
```
python3 -m pip install "git+https://github.com/ISISNeutronMuon/MDANSE@protos#egg=MDANSE&subdirectory=MDANSE"
python3 -m pip install "git+https://github.com/ISISNeutronMuon/MDANSE@protos#egg=MDANSE_GUI&subdirectory=MDANSE_GUI"
```

## Quick start: the workflow

The typical workflow of MDANSE:

1. Convert a trajectory from the file format generated by an MD simulation software into the MDANSE trajectory format,
2. Load the converted trajectory into MDANSE,
3. Perform an analysis,
4. Check the results with the plotter.


The most complete user documentation of MDANSE can be found on [our Read the Docs page](https://mdanse.readthedocs.io/en/protos).
At the same time, it is still possible to access the original **[MDANSE User Guide](https://epubs.stfc.ac.uk/work/51935555)**.

Other information including example scripts can be found on the [MDANSE website](https://www.isis.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/MDANSEproject.aspx) 
while the most recent tutorials are stored in the [MDANSE examples repository](https://github.com/ISISNeutronMuon/MDANSE-Examples).

## What can MDANSE do?

Firstly, MDANSE can read the output of MD simulation software. It does this by providing converters for different file formats
into an .MDT file (HDF format), which is then used for all calculations. The following MD packages are supported:

- CASTEP
- CHARMM
- DFTB 
- Discover 
- DL_POLY 
- DMol 
- Forcite
- Gromacs
- LAMMPS
- NAMD
- PDB
- VASP
- XPLOR
- ASE

The converted trajectory can then be loaded into MDANSE, where it can be visualised and animated.
Then, various properties can be calculated from the positions and velocities of atoms.
The results can be compared with neutron (or, for some analysis types, with X-ray or IR)
experimental data, or used as a prediction of results of a potential experiment.

The following properties can be computed:

<details><summary>Dynamics</summary><ul>
<li>Angular correlation</li>
<li>Density of states</li>
<li>Mean Square Displacement</li>
<li>Position Autocorrelation Function</li>
<li>Velocity Autocorrelation Function</li>
<li>Current Correlation Function</li>
<li>van Hove function (self)</li>
<li>van Hove function (distinct)</li>
</ul></details>

<li>X-Ray Static Structure Factor</li>
</ul></details>

<details><summary>Thermodynamics</summary><ul>
<li>Density</li>
<li>Temperature</li>
</ul></details>

Each of these analyses can be controlled using a number of parameters. For example,
the user can select a subset of trajectory frames or a subset of atoms
on which to perform the calculation, or specified atoms can be substituted with
different elements/isotopes. Finally, their results can be saved in an MDA file (HDF5 format)
and plotted directly in MDANSE, 
or saved a set of DAT files (text format) to be processed by the user using
their own software of choice.

be found on [our Read the Docs page](https://mdanse.readthedocs.io/en/protos).
