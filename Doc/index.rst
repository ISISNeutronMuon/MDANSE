Welcome to MDANSE's documentation!
==================================

.. note::
   This is the documentation of the MDANSE 2.0 release.
   The documentation, just like the code itself, is still under development.

Introduction

**MDANSE** (**Molecular Dynamics Analysis for Neutron Scattering Experiments**)
is a python application designed for computing neutron observables
from molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories that can be directly compared with
neutron scattering experiments, particularly inelastic and quasi-elastic
neutron scattering spectroscopies.

To do this, it interfaces with a variety of MD simulation software such
as CASTEP, VASP, DMOL, Gromacs, DL_POLY, CHARMM, LAMMPS, PBD, DFTB etc., 
and provides both a graphical user interface (GUI) and a command line interface. 

This project is built on the development published previously: \
G. Goret, B. Aoun, E. Pellegrini, "MDANSE: An Interactive Analysis Environment for Molecular Dynamics Simulations", 
J Chem Inf Model. 57(1):1-5 (2017).
