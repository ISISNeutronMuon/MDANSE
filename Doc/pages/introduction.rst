Introduction
============

Neutron scattering experiments are valuable tools for investigating atomic
positions and molecular dynamics in materials. Computational simulations and
modeling play a crucial role in analyzing and interpreting such experiments,
leading to improvements in existing materials and the design of new ones.
Atomistic simulations, particularly molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, are
increasingly employed for these purposes. However, predicting neutron observables
from MD trajectories is a complex process that involves various calculations and
transformations, such as mean square displacements, densities of states, velocity
and position auto- and cross-correlation functions, Fourier transformations, and
convolutions with instrument parameters, to obtain neutron observables that can
be directly compared with experimental data.

MDANSE: Your Gateway to Insights
--------------------------------

Some of these essential steps have been meticulously implemented within MDANSE
(Molecular Dynamics Analysis of Neutron Scattering Experiments) [^Ref1^]. This
Python-based application has established connections with more than ten MD codes,
including powerful ab initio MD packages detailed in Trajectory Converters.

Purpose and Capabilities
------------------------

MDANSE serves as a versatile toolkit designed to streamline the analysis of
molecular dynamics simulations. Its primary objectives are to:

- Facilitate the visualization and animation of trajectory data.
- Enable the computation of various properties, including dynamics, infrared,
  scattering, structural, and thermodynamic properties.

Flexibility and Compatibility
-----------------------------

MDANSE offers:

- A user-friendly Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) for effortless
  analysis and visualization.
- Command-line utilities that can be seamlessly integrated into Python scripts
  for accessibility and adaptability.
- A molecular viewer and a versatile 2D/3D plotter to enhance the user experience
  when dissecting neutron experimental data.
