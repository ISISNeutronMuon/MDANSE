Using MDANSE Graphical User Interface
=====================================

The new MDANSE GUI is a separate Python package that can be installed
using pip.

It is based on QtPy interface which will use your Python bindings of choice
to interface with the Qt libraries. The interface should work as long as
you have *one of the following* installed:

- PyQt5
- PyQt6
- PySide 2

More documentation of the GUI will follow as the interface becomes more complete.
