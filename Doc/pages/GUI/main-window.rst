The main window
---------------

Below is an image of the window you will see when you open MDANSE GUI.
All the parts have been marked and their short descriptions can be found
below. Further information on all parts is in the following sections.

Please note that all pictures come from Windows 10, so the GUI will look
very slightly different on other platforms. However, MDANSE works
equally well, bugs notwithstanding, on all platforms.

1.  `File menu <#_The_File_menu>`__ handles file manipulation. It can be
    used to load NetCDF trajectories or to convert other trajectories
    into the NetCDF format.
2.  `View menu <#_The_View_menu>`__ allows you to hide/show various
    parts of MDANSE.
3.  `Help menu <#_The_Help_menu>`__ contains access to files that you
    can use to better understand MDANSE and the theory behind it.
4.  `Load trajectory button <#_Load_data>`__ can be used to load a
    NetCDF trajectory.
5.  `Periodic table viewer <#_Periodic_table_viewer>`__ opens a periodic
    table containing the constants and data that MDANSE uses for
    calculations.
6.  `Elements database editor <#_Elements_database_editor>`__ allows you
    to change the atomic constants that MDANSE uses for calculations.
7.  `2D/3D Plotter <#_2D/3D_Plotter>`__ launches a window where the
    calculated data can be plotted, and the plots formatted.
8.  **User definitions editor** opens a window where you can view the
    definitions that have been created for each trajectory. More on
    definitions in `Selections <#_Creating_selections>`__.
9.  `Units editor <#_Unites_Editor>`__ opens a window where the units
    used in MDANSE can be managed.
10. **MDANSE classes framework** allows you to peruse the documentation
    for the classes that make up MDANSE. This is useful if you want to
    use MDANSE from the command line.
11. **Save analysis template** allows you to create a new analysis. This
    will be available in My jobs inside the Plugins panel and can be run
    like the native analyses.
12. **Open MDANSE API** opens MDANSE documentation in a browser. This is
    very similar to MDANSE classes framework.
13. **Open MDANSE website** opens the MDANSE
    website[`8 <#SignetBibliographie_008>`__] in a browser.
14. **About** launches a window with very basic information about the
    MDANSE you have installed.
15. **Bug report** opens your default mail application. Please use this
    or create an issue on MDANSE
    GitHub[`9 <#SignetBibliographie_009>`__] to inform us of any issues
    you have come across.
16. `Quit MDANSE <#_Quit>`__ closes the MDANSE window.
17. `Data panel <#_Data_panel>`__ contains any NetCDF files you loaded
    into MDANSE using either #4 Load trajectory button, or from #1 File
    menu > Load trajectory.
18. `Plugins panel <#_Plugins_panel>`__ contains all the options you can
    do with the selected trajectory.
19. `Working panel <#_Working_panel>`__ shows the trajectories you have
    opened. To open a trajectory, double click a trajectory in #16 Data
    panel. You can then inspect the system described by the trajectory.
20. **Logger** shows all the messages generated by MDANSE. These can be
    errors or information messages, such as ones confirming you saved a
    script etc.
21. **Console** is a Python shell. It can be used like normal when
    python is being used from the command line, i.e.. when python is
    typed and executed in an OS shell. It contains all the bundled
    modules, but you will need to import them first.
22. `Jobs <#_Jobs>`__ shows the status of all current jobs. Once you
    start an analysis or trajectory conversion, you can view its
    progress here.
