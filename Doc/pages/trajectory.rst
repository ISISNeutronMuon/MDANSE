Trajectory Converters
=====================

Below is the list of converters present in MDANSE. These converters allow for the
outputs of a variety of MD simulation software to be able to be used in
MDANSE by converting the various file formats to the HDF format. These trajectory
converters convert positions and other vital
information such as the unit cell parameters.
