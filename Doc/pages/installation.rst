Installing MDANSE
=================

MDANSE can be downloaded from https://mdanse.org/downloads/. It is a
platform-specific installer that can be used directly and without any
other software. The package that gets installed comes with all the
necessary libraries and files that MDANSE requires to run. New versions
of MDANSE are released after sufficient changes are made, but in the
meantime MDANSE can be built from source. Instructions for doing that
are given in `Appendix 4 <#_Appendix_4>`__. Some beta versions may also
be generated by our continuous integration
[`2 <#SignetBibliographie_002>`__].

Windows
-------

Installing MDANSE on Windows is straightforward. Once downloaded, you
will get MDANSE.exe file which can be run like any other exe installer.
If you want to install MDANSE, you need to have administrator
privileges, ie. Windows will ask you if you really want to install the
software, and you might need to enter your password. When that is done,
you will see a welcome screen, followed by a license agreement.

The default installation location is in C:\\Program Files\\MDANSE, but
it can be changed to any location. Once you select next, the
installation will start, which may take a while.

Finally, you will see a screen where you can select some extra options.
If you want to have a desktop shortcut, don’t forget to check the box.
The ‘View CHANGELOG’ link at the bottom will open CHANGELOG.txt file
where you can see what has changed.

MacOS
-----

Since version 1.5.1, MDANSE installer for MacOS comes with a README.txt
file that will be unzipped together with the MDANSE.dmg installer once
you download MDANSE. Inside are the installation instructions as well as
instructions for using MDANSE from the command line. Despite the aid
however, MDANSE can be installed like any other DMG file:

1. Double click the DMG file. A window should open.
2. Drag the MDANSE icon onto the folder icon.
3. Wait for copying to finish.
4. Eject the DMG and delete it.

Once that is done, MDANSE will be installed in /Applications, and so you
can run it like other applications. However, since we are not registered
with Apple, you might have to go through some extra steps to run. For
that purpose, the guides in Ref [`3 <#SignetBibliographie_003>`__] and
Ref [`4 <#SignetBibliographie_004>`__] might be of help.

Linux
-----

We provide MDANSE.deb installer, so if your system is Debian-based, you
can directly use this like any other DEB package:

1. Un-tar the tarball.
2. In terminal run (make sure to use the correct path and full name of
   the DEB file):

sudo apt install ./MDANSE.deb

Apt will install any missing dependencies, so once you approve when
prompted and wait for installation to finish, you can start the MDANSE
either from terminal or from applications list.

If you use a system that does not support DEB natively, you will most
likely have to build MDANSE from source code. Feel free to try using
conversion packages, such as Alien, but we have not been able to make
this work. Instructions on building from source are in `Appendix
4 <#_Appendix_4>`__ and issue #8 on our
GitHub.[`5 <#SignetBibliographie_005>`__] If you are still facing
difficulties, do not hesitate to contact us!
