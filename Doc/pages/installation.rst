Installing MDANSE
=================

MDANSE can be downloaded from [Ref38]_. At the moment we provide
Python wheels which, after downloading, can be installed using pip:

.. code-block:: console

  pip install MDANSE-X.Y.Z-...-.whl

followed by

.. code-block:: console

  pip install MDANSE_GUI-X.Y.Z-...-.whl

in order to enable the graphical interface as well.

It is our intention to add MDANSE to the PyPI, so that it can be installed
directly from the package repository using pip.
