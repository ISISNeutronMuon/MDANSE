================

MDANSE was born at the ILL in 2012, as an extension of the nMOLDYN
program, originally developed by Gerald Kneller in 1995. Subsequent
versions of nMOLDYN were further developed by Gerald Kneller, Konrad
Hinsen and Eric Pellegrini. We are grateful to all the people who have
helped in some way or another to improve nMOLDYN and/or MDANSE over
those years. Apart from the main developers mentioned above, we would
like to acknowledge explicitly the contributions done in the past by
Bachir Aoun, Vania Calandrini, Paolo Calligari, Gael Goret and Remi
Perenon.

We would also like to thank Remi Perenon (ESRF), Dominik Jochym (SCD)
and Franz Lang (ISIS) for useful discussions during the redaction of
this manual.

The MDANSE project is supported by Ada Lovelace Centre and ISIS Neutron
and Muon Source, Science and Technology Facilities Council, UKRI. Past
financial support from the Institut Laue-Langevin and the French Agence
Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) through contracts No.
