MDANSE is a modern interface for analysis of molecular dynamics
trajectories from a wide range of simulation packages.
It started as a fork of
`version 3 of the nMOLDYN program <https://github.com/khinsen/nMOLDYN3>`_.
nMOLDYN was originally developed by Gerald Kneller in 1995
and subsequently also by Konrad Hinsen, Tomasz Rog, Krzysztof Murzyn,
Slawomir Stachura, and Eric Pellegrini. MDANSE uses nMOLDYN3 for
the most computationally intensive analyses, and also code from
the libraries `MMTK <https://github.com/khinsen/MMTK>`_ and
`ScientificPython <https://github.com/khinsen/ScientificPython>`_,
in order to reduce dependencies and thus facilitate installation.
For more information on the history and successive developments
of nMoldyn, see the references [nMOLDYN_ref1]_,
[nMOLDYN_ref2]_,  [nMOLDYN_ref3]_.
The latest version of nMOLDYN3 can be found
`here <http://dirac.cnrs-orleans.fr/nMOLDYN.html>`_.

We are grateful to all the people who have contributed to
nMOLDYN and MDANSE. Apart from the main developers mentioned above,
we would like to acknowledge explicitly the contributions of
Bachir Aoun, Vania Calandrini, Paolo Calligari, Gael Goret and Remi Perenon.
The MDANSE project is currently supported by Ada Lovelace Centre,
ISIS Neutron and Muon Source, Science and Technology Facilities
Council, UKRI, and the Institut Laue-Langevin (Grenoble, France).
Past financial support from the French Agence Nationale de la
Recherche (ANR) through contracts No. ANR-2010-COSI-001-01 and
ANR-06-CIS6-012-01, and the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme
of the European Union under project number 654000 is also acknowledged.

We would also like to thank Remi Perenon (ESRF), Dominik Jochym (SCD)
and Franz Lang (ISIS) for useful discussions during the redaction of
this manual.
