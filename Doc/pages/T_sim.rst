Setting Up Molecular Dynamics Simulations
=========================================

This tutorial provides a guide on performing neutron scattering analysis using the MDANSE software. We will cover launching MDANSE, loading trajectory data in HDF format, configuring the analysis, troubleshooting common issues, and saving simulation data.

Launching MDANSE and Loading HDF Trajectory
--------------------------------------------

**Launch MDANSE:**
- Begin by launching MDANSE, either by double-clicking its icon or running it from the command line, if necessary.

**Load HDF Trajectory:**
- Once MDANSE is running, ensure that you have your molecular dynamics trajectory data in the HDF format loaded into the software, suitable for neutron scattering analysis.

- To load the HDF trajectory, follow these steps:
  - Go to the "File" menu at the top of the MDANSE window.
  - Select "Load Trajectory" from the dropdown menu.
  - Browse your file system and select the MDANSE HDF trajectory file you want to analyze. Click "Open" to load it into MDANSE.

Configuring Dynamic Coherent Structure Factor Analysis
-------------------------------------------------------

**Access Analysis Menu:**
- In the MDANSE GUI, navigate to the "Analysis" menu located at the top of the window.

**Initiate Analysis:**
- From the "Analysis" menu, choose "Dynamic Coherent Structure Factor" to initiate the analysis. This opens a dialog for configuring the analysis parameters.

**Configure Analysis Parameters:**
- In the "Dynamic Coherent Structure Factor" dialog, configure the analysis parameters as follows:
  - Frames: For this analysis, we want to analyze all frames of the HDF trajectory. You can specify a range of frames if needed (Default: First: 0, Last: Entire trajectory, Step: 1).
  - Instrument Resolution: Leave this setting at its default value for this neutron scattering example.
  - Q Vectors: Select the "Isotropic" option for Q vectors as we want to analyze a wide range of scattering vectors in all directions suitable for neutron scattering experiments.
  - Atom Selection: Choose "All" to analyze all atoms in the system relevant to your neutron scattering analysis.
  - Atom Transmutation: No specific atom transmutation is needed for this analysis, so leave it at its default setting.
  - Weights: MDANSE will automatically calculate weights based on neutron coherent scattering lengths, so leave this setting at its default value.
  - Output Files: You can specify the output file format and location. For this example, we'll use the default settings, which typically include HDF as the format.

**Troubleshooting Tips:**
- **Issue:** If MDANSE encounters an error during the analysis setup, double-check the configuration parameters, ensuring they are appropriate for your data and analysis. Pay special attention to the Q Vectors and Atom Selection.
- **Issue:** If the analysis takes an unexpectedly long time to complete, review your system specifications and the number of frames in your trajectory. It may be beneficial to reduce the number of frames or use a more efficient workstation.

Running the Analysis
---------------------

**Initiate Analysis Run:**
- After configuring the analysis parameters in the "Dynamic Coherent Structure Factor" dialog, click the "Run" button within the dialog to initiate the analysis.

**Monitor Progress:**
- MDANSE will start performing the calculations, and you'll see progress indicators or logs in the MDANSE interface.

**Review Results:**
- Once the analysis is complete, MDANSE will generate the results, including the total and partial dynamic coherent structure factors, and save them in the default HDF file format, which you specified earlier. These HDF files will typically be located in the default output location.

Saving Simulation Data
-----------------------

**Save Project:**
- In MDANSE, go to the "File" menu and select "Save" to save your project. This will save your current analysis configuration and settings.

**Export Data:**
- To save simulation trajectories, energy profiles, and other relevant data, consult MDANSE's documentation or menu options specific to data export. You can typically export data in various formats, including text, CSV, or specific file formats for further analysis in external software.

Organizing and Storing Simulation Results
-----------------------------------------

- Organizing and storing simulation results effectively is crucial for easy access and future analysis. Consider creating a dedicated folder or directory structure for your simulation project and its associated data. You can organize it as follows:
  - Create a main project folder with a descriptive name.
  - Within the project folder, create subfolders for specific types of data (e.g., "Trajectories," "Energy Profiles," "Analysis Results").
  - Save simulation trajectories, energy profiles, and other data in their respective subfolders.

- Additionally, consider using version control systems or documenting your work to track changes and ensure reproducibility of your simulations
